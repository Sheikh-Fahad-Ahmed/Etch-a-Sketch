# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-a-Sketch is a project about creating a sketchbook like
website where you use mouse and  number of squares of your choice
to fill in and create a pixelated art.

This project helped me learn more about hovering effect, flexbox,
and javascript logic to create multiple tags and style them.

Tools: Javascript, HTML, CSS
